# Catalyst

## What is it?
Catalyst is a "plugin" for hyprland that creates your keybinds based off json instead of hyprland.
It is only dependent on hyprland

## Installing

**From source**

Install the build requirements with a package manager of your choice:
- git
- gcc

Then run

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Matercan/catalyst.git
g++ main.cpp -o catalyst -l jsoncpp
mv catalyst /usr/bin/
```

**From the aur**

To be added soon

## Usage

```
What is catalyst?
Catalyst is a package which allows you to use JSON to create keybinds in hyprland
Your config file is by default stored in ~/.config/catalyst/config.json
Args:

catalyst --help:                 Shows this text
catalyst --config:               Sets your config file
catalyst --keybinds-file:        Sets the file with your keybinds
```

You may run catalyst as ``exec-once`` because it deletes the previous keybinds it generated.
Do *not* delete the Strings to signal the start/end of the generated keybinds,
or it will either delete your old keybinds or duplicate them

## Configuration
By default, a configuration file is created when building to ``${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/catalyst/config.json``
but catalyst can also be made to use a different file with the --config option.

An example configuration looks like this:
```json
{
  "$schema": "/home/Matercan/projects/catalyst/schema.json",
  "play": {
    "key-sequence": [
      "CONTROL",
      "SUPER",
      "s"
    ],
    "command": "playerctl play-pause"
  },
  "reload": {
    "key-sequence": [
      "CONTROL",
      "SUPER",
      "E"
    ],
    "command": "eww reload"
  }
}
```
```
# ------- Generated by Catalyst ------- 

bind =  CONTROL SUPER,  s, exec, playerctl play-pause
bind =  CONTROL SUPER,  E, exec, eww reload

# ------ End of code by Catalyst ------ 
```
The names of each keybind doesn't matter, nor does the length of the key-sequence.
Modifiers and keys will be sorted automatically. Modifiers are:
CONTROL, MAINMOD, SHIFT, and SUPER. MAINMOD will be set to $mainMod in the hyprland config.
So far this only works for terminal commands not hyprland dispatchers. It is Todo.
